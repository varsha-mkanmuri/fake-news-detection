California Attorney General Kamala Harris has pledged to file briefs in support of the contraceptive mandate in the Hobby Lobby case before the U.S. Supreme Court.

In a press release announcing this pledge, Harris said:

“This case impacts millions of Americans, and it is crucial that their voices are heard. I will file briefs to make sure they are included in the legal proceedings. It will be my highest priority to defend the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, including the mandate that employers provide coverage for contraceptives. As the state’s chief legal officer, my duty is to defend the laws of the state and the will of its people.”
